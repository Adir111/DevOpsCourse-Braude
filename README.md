# DevOps Course - Braude College

This repository is used for the **DevOps** course I’m taking at **Braude College**. It contains all the course materials, exercises, and projects for the class.

## Purpose

The content in this repo is designed to help with learning and applying DevOps principles throughout the course. It covers a range of topics and tools in DevOps, and will include code, configurations, and assignments as we go along.

Feel free to explore the files, and stay tuned for updates as we progress through the course!
